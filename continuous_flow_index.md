Soul-Module Insight: Early demonstration of patience, attentiveness, and mercy.

Transition 1 → 2

Purpose: Move from playful surface currents to reflective dusk. Light, mood, and pace shift.
Narrative Function: Prepares reader for deeper observation and moral reflection in Anchor 2.

Anchor 2 – At Dusk

Theme: Memory without complaint / Nature listening without judgment
Voice Layer: Underflow (slow, old)
Narrative Elements: Dusk as moral atmosphere, objects dropped, human echoes
Summary: The creek reflects on the day, absorbs minor events (marble example), and demonstrates passive moral witnessing.

Anchor 4 – Witness as moral act

Theme: Witness as moral act / Attention as healing

Anchor 6 – Memory without complaint

Notes:

Each anchor and transition is designed for continuous flow, so reading straight through creates a unified narrative.

Voice layers move from Surface → Underflow → Deep Silence → Surface → Underflow, showing moral, reflective, and playful layers.

Themes are explicitly tied to moral and ethical reflection in line with the soul-module framework.

This index is meant for editors, contributors, and long-term project planning, not for casual reading.
