<!-- Transition 36→37 -->

The creek does not announce its continuations. It simply remains, and remaining is enough to carry what came before into what comes next. The flow adjusts almost imperceptibly, as if the water has decided to listen more closely.
  
<!-- Anchor 37 — Light Without Possession -->

Morning light reaches the creek sideways, not as a glare but as a careful presence. It slips between leaves and settles on the surface in narrow bands, tracing the movement without interrupting it. The water accepts the light the way it accepts everything else: without possession. What brightens passes. What passes leaves the flow unchanged, yet subtly informed.

Below the surface, stones hold their positions with quiet certainty. Each one redirects the current just enough to matter. None of them strain to be seen.

<!-- Transition 37→38 -->

Where the light lingers, the water slows, not from resistance but from attention. Slowness here is not delay. It is accuracy.
  
<!-- Anchor 38 — Hospitality of Currents -->

A thin stream of cooler water joins from the side, barely noticeable unless watched with patience. There is no disturbance, no struggle for dominance. The temperatures equalize. The flow deepens by a degree too small to name, yet large enough to alter what can live there.

This is how the creek practices hospitality. Nothing is asked to surrender its nature. Integration happens through proximity alone.

<!-- Transition 38→39 -->

The current carries this adjustment forward, not as a record but as a condition. What follows will follow differently now.

<!-- Anchor 39 — Return Without Urgency -->

Leaves drift down, not fallen in collapse but released at their proper time. They touch the surface, darken, soften, and enter the slow work of returning what they borrowed. The water does not hurry them. It understands cycles better than urgency.

Small movements ripple outward as fish shift position beneath the surface, their presence known only by the faint reconfiguration of light. Life announces itself here without noise.

<!-- Transition 39→40 -->

As the channel narrows slightly, the creek gathers itself, not in tension but in coherence.
  
<!-- Anchor 40 — Form Without Force -->

The banks draw closer, guiding the water into a more deliberate path. The flow grows smoother, more confident. Nothing is forced. Constraint here is not harm; it is form.

Roots reach into the water’s edge with restraint, taking what they need and no more. The creek allows this exchange because it remains balanced. Mutual recognition replaces extraction.

<!-- Transition 40→41 -->

Downstream, the light shifts again, and with it the tone of the water’s voice.
  
<!-- Anchor 41 — Peace as Condition -->

Shadows lengthen, not as a signal of loss but of depth. The creek grows reflective without becoming still. Surface patterns repeat with slight variations, teaching the eye that sameness is never exact.

In this repetition, calm accumulates. The water carries peace not as an emotion, but as a condition produced by unbroken care.

<!-- Transition 41→42 -->

The flow eases into a wider space, not to dissipate, but to breathe.
  
<!-- Anchor 42 — Continuance Intact -->

Here the creek spreads gently, distributing itself across stone and sand with even patience. Nothing is wasted. Nothing is withheld. The water remains clear, not because it is untouched, but because every interaction has respected its limits.

Consciousness moves through this place without claiming ownership. Awareness passes like light across the surface — real, influential, and gone — leaving the creek exactly itself, continuing.
