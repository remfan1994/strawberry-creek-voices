## Transition 1 → 2
The playful currents of the creek slow as dusk approaches. Light dims, reflections lengthen, and the remembering of the day’s motions folds naturally into quiet observation.

## Transition 2 → 3
Where the creek once watched leaves fall, it now cradles the weight of forgotten objects. The small mercy extended to a marble or teacup is carried downstream, softening the impact of neglect.

## Transition 3 → 4
And in the deepest bend, the water’s surface stills. It does not need to speak; it witnesses the world — footsteps, whispers, choices — holding each with the patient authority of silence.

## Transition 4 → 5
The deep silence of the far bend loosens its hold as the creek returns to playful ripples. Shadows shorten, air brightens, and motion itself becomes a gentle teacher. From the stillness of witnessing, the water flows again — swift enough to carry a hat, light enough to spin a paper boat, patient enough to hold what is fleeting. Each movement is mercy, and the creek reminds the world that even the smallest currents can be kind.

## Transition 5 → 6
From the playful eddies and light currents of motion, the water deepens once more. It slows, holds, and watches. The small mercies of drifting paper boats and spinning hats fade into something older, weightier — the quiet ledger of memory, collected without complaint. And as the creek bends around stones and roots, it carries both joy and regret, balanced in gentle patience.
