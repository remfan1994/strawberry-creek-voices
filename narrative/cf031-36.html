<!-- Transition 30→31 -->

The creek shifts its weight over stones that have borne it for seasons.
Currents press against their edges, bending without breaking.
Movement is neither free nor forced; it passes where the channel allows, guided by what holds it in place.
Even freedom takes its shape from what sustains it.

<!-- Anchor 31 — Confluence -->

The water meets a joining stream.
Their currents twist together, brushing against roots and moss, negotiating passage without erasing what carries them.
Pebbles tumble underfoot, polished by encounters. The creek carries memory of its own limits, the gentle insistence of barriers that are agreements, not commands.

Willow and alder bend at the meeting, shading the confluence in shifting patterns. Dragonflies skim the surface, tracing the interaction with delicate arcs, marking attention without interruption.

The confluence teaches itself how to move, not by imposing, but by being held.
What can flow is shaped by what remains; what remains is strengthened by what can flow.
