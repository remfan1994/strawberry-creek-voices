<h1>Strawberry Creek Voices — Geography Registry</h1>
<pre>Understood — we can remove snow-related entries and focus only on phenomena relevant to your environment. Here’s the **revised plain-text weather registry**, still detailed, double line breaks preserved, with snow/ice storm entries removed and all remaining entries tailored to local conditions:

---

Prolonged Heat

Temperatures remain consistently above the seasonal average for multiple consecutive days or weeks. Ground and surface materials retain warmth into the night. Soil moisture decreases gradually. Air humidity may rise or remain low depending on local conditions.

Extended Drought

Precipitation remains below normal levels over an extended period. Rivers, streams, and water bodies decrease in volume or dry up. Soil becomes dry and cracked. Vegetation shows signs of stress. Groundwater reserves decline slowly.

Persistent Overcast / Low Light

Cloud cover remains extensive for days or weeks. Direct sunlight is limited or absent. Diffuse light dominates the landscape. Shadows are minimal or soft. Temperature variation between day and night is reduced.

Strong, Persistent Wind

Wind speeds consistently exceed normal averages over extended periods. Direction may be steady or variable. Vegetation is visibly bent or swayed. Dust, sand, or loose debris may be carried. Small objects may be displaced.

Wildfire Smoke

Smoke from nearby or regional fires is present in the air. Visibility decreases. Particulates accumulate on surfaces. Smell of smoke is detectable. Air quality indexes rise, sometimes to hazardous levels.

Sudden Cold Snap

Temperatures drop sharply within hours or a single day. Frost may form on surfaces. Water bodies may partially freeze. Wind chill increases. Vegetation is exposed to sudden thermal stress.

Flood Cycles

Water levels in rivers, streams, or low-lying areas rise above typical bounds. Soil becomes saturated. Standing water appears in depressions. Erosion or sediment displacement may occur. Pathways and lowland terrain may become inaccessible.

Heavy Rain / Storms

Precipitation occurs at high intensity, often for hours or days. Ground becomes saturated quickly. Water accumulation on surfaces occurs. Small streams may form or swell. Visibility may be reduced. Lightning and thunder may accompany storms.

Frost / Ice

Freezing temperatures persist overnight or for multiple days. Surfaces become coated with ice. Water puddles or shallow bodies freeze. Vegetation may be coated or stiffened. Pathways and exposed terrain become slippery.

Fog / Low Visibility

Air is saturated with moisture, reducing visual range to tens or hundreds of meters. Humidity is high. Surfaces may become damp or slick. Light diffuses unevenly. Movement across terrain is slowed.

Hail Events

Precipitation includes ice pellets of variable size. Ground and surfaces are impacted with noise and occasional damage. Vegetation may be damaged. Temporary accumulation occurs.

Wind Chill Episodes

Perceived temperatures are significantly lower due to wind speed. Exposed skin cools faster. Frostbite risk may increase. Snow or ice may drift across surfaces.

If you like, the next step is **structuring this into SCV anchor arrays** exactly like your other pages (`species.html`, `geography.html`) so the continuous flow can reference it seamlessly. Do you want me to do that?
