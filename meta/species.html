 Absolutely — and here’s a **preliminary, biology-grounded list** of species around **Strawberry Creek** (Berkeley, CA) that you can refine and upload into your `/meta/` as a reference for SCV metaphor work. I’m drawing on documented creek ecology, restoration data, and local habitat surveys to make this credible both ecologically and narratively.

## **Strawberry Creek Species Inventory (Plants & Animals)**

### **Aquatic & Riparian Animals**

**Fish reintroduced or present in the creek**

* Sacramento Sucker *(Catostomus occidentalis)* — bottom-dwelling native fish in deeper pools. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][1])
* California Roach Minnow *(Hesperoleucus symmetricus)* — small schooling fish in mid-water. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][1])
* Three-spined Stickleback *(Gasterosteus aculeatus)* — small near-bank fish. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][1])

(*Note:* historical populations once included salmonids like steelhead and coho, but these are not currently present due to alteration and urban impacts. ([Wikipedia][2]))

**Invertebrates & Creek Surface Life**

* Water Strider *(Aquarius remigis)* — “skates” the water surface. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][3])
* Benthic macroinvertebrate larvae (e.g., midges, damselflies; caddisflies, worms) — important aquatic insects. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][3])

**Terrestrial & Semi-Aquatic Creatures Nearby**

* Fox Squirrel — common small mammal near shaded riparian areas. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][4])
* Arboreal & Slender Salamanders — occur in rock walls, moist areas upstream. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][4])
* Birds (resident and migratory):

  * Scrub Jay, Stellar Jay — woodland birds near shaded creek zones. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][4])
  * Brown Towhee, Mourning Dove, Robins — common riparian and adjacent habitat birds. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][4])
  * Winter Wren, Creeper, Varied Thrush — more forest-like species recorded in shady forks. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][4])

*(Local observations also suggest possible sightings of owls such as Great Horned Owl and night herons near wetter sections at certain times — useful if you want narratively evocative species but less formally documented in the core creek ecology.)* ([reddit.com][5])

**Large Mammals in Adjacent Wildlands (stray into watershed)**

* Deer, Coyote, Bobcat, Mountain Lion — range into the greater Strawberry Canyon ecosystem, especially outside urban core. ([Creeks of UC Berkeley][4])

### **Flora — Plants Along the Creek & Immediate Riparian Zone**

**Native & planted woody vegetation**

* *Toyon* *(Heteromeles arbutifolia)* — native shrub/small tree with red berries in the Bay Area. ([PocketSights][6])

**Common Riparian Trees & Shrubs**
(*Note:* many riparian plant lists include both native and non-native species due to urban landscaping and restoration work.)

* California Buckeye *(Aesculus californica)* — native riparian margin tree (often planted/restored).
* Willow species *(Salix spp.)* — classic creekside trees in many riparian corridors (implanted or remnant).
* Alder *(Alnus spp.)* — bankside trees stabilizing soil (typical of Sonoma/Marin/Contra Costa riparian corridors).

**Herbaceous & Groundcover Plant Life**

* Blackberry *(Rubus spp.)* — widespread brambles along banks offering cover and food.
* Native wildflowers / meadow plants near the creek’s edges during wetter seasons.
  *(Exact taxa vary with microhabitat; local native gardens around Strawberry Creek Park include California native plantings.)* ([Berkeleyside][7])

**Invasive & Exotic Plants (commonly present)**

* Algerian Ivy, English Ivy — aggressive non-native groundcover. ([Wikipedia][2])
* Himalayan Blackberry — common invasive bramble. ([bpfp.org][8])
* Siberian Elm (*Ulmus pumila*), French Broom, Pampas Grass — recorded in local restoration notes. ([fivecreeks.org][9])

- Brown Towhee
- Mourning Dove
- Robins
- (Occasional: Great Horned Owl, Night Heron)

### Mammals & Amphibians
- Fox Squirrel
- Arboreal & Slender Salamanders
- Deer, Coyote, Bobcat, Mountain Lion (near watershed)

### Plants — Native & Riparian
- Toyon (native shrub)
