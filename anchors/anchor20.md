Moral Note: First anchor where Repetition and Watchfulness are practically demonstrated

Anchor 20 – The Luminous Bend

Light falls across a curving stretch of the creek, illuminating stones and insects alike. The water reflects more than the sky—it mirrors decisions made, the subtle energy of watchfulness transformed into action.

Ripples fan outward; moss, leaf, and creature respond. Movements are measured, each one purposeful. The observer notes the impact, seeing how focus and alignment translate into change. Here, action is both humble and profound: the glen’s patterns yield to attention, and attention yields to life.
