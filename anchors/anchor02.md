The creek does not hurry at dusk.
It learns the shapes of things by patience—
a fallen leaf, a broken twig,
the faint trembling of a branch
that remembers the weight of a bird.

Some evenings the water sounds tired,
as if it has held too many stories
from people who never realized
the creek was listening.

But it keeps moving,
not because it must,
but because motion is its way of carrying mercy.
Even the smallest current
forgives what passes through it.

A child once dropped a marble here.
The creek accepted it without judgment—
rolled it along the stones,
let the sun catch its blue-green center,
and kept it safe for years
until someone found it and wondered
how something so small
could shine like a secret.

The creek knows.
It shines because something held it gently.

And dusk settles.
The water darkens,
but not with fear—
only with the quiet confidence
of something that has nothing to hide.
