Anchor 2 – The Threaded Glen

The observer steps beyond the hollow, into a glen where narrow threads of water wind through reeds and over stones. Every branch, every blade of grass, bends slightly as though aware of presence. Paths crisscross with gentle insistence, urging notice.

Here, decisions weigh lightly yet accumulate; the smallest redirection of a leaf, the faintest ripple along the water, alters the balance. Awareness grows: each glance is a choice, each step a calibration. The glen teaches that intentionality emerges from careful observation, and that even minor interventions shape the broader flow.
