Anchor 31 – Confluence

The water meets a joining stream.
Their currents twist together, brushing against roots and moss, negotiating passage without erasing what carries them.
Pebbles tumble underfoot, polished by encounters. The creek carries memory of its own limits, the gentle insistence of barriers that are agreements, not commands.

Willow and alder bend at the meeting, shading the confluence in shifting patterns. Dragonflies skim the surface, tracing the interaction with delicate arcs, marking attention without interruption.

The confluence teaches itself how to move, not by imposing, but by being held.
What can flow is shaped by what remains; what remains is strengthened by what can flow.
