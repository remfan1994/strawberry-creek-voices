Anchor 25 – What Settles

Some things arrive quietly.  Downstream of meeting, the water carries less argument.

Not everything that moves through the creek leaves at once. Fine silt collects where the water slows, laying itself down between stones already darkened by algae. Sycamore leaves gather along shallow bends, their edges softening as they take on the creek’s pace rather than resisting it.  They drift, hesitate, then edge toward the inside bend where the current slackens. Nothing announces itself, yet everything is instructional. The creek does not hurry explanation; it allows weight to decide what belongs.

Crayfish wait beneath rocks where the flow breaks. They do not rush the open water. They remain attentive to what drifts past, testing the space before committing themselves. Even here, even now, the creek teaches that arrival is gradual, supported by what lies beneath. What matters is rarely what passes loudest. It is what settles, what remains after movement has spent itself.

What settles is not forgotten.
It becomes part of the bed, altering how future water will pass.
