Anchor 15 – Small Lives at Dusk (Text)

In the quiet of night, tiny creatures come to the water’s edge. A frog pauses on a stone, observing the subtle movements of the current. Insects skim across the surface, leaving tiny ripples that echo briefly before dissolving. Seeds drift, twigs float, and soft biodegradable fragments settle into nourishing soil.

The creek bends around stones, redwood roots, and tule reeds with gentle authority, teaching that even small lives and minor currents matter. Every movement is recorded and carried onward, a testament to patience and attentiveness. In these moments, the creek shows that care and moral attention extend to all who touch its waters.
