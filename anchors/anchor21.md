Anchor 21 – The Hollowed Spire

A solitary spire of rock rises from the creek, hollowed and worn, a vantage for reflection. Shadows trace its curves, and the observer senses the results of prior steps. Some ripples advanced life subtly, others less so.

Here, assessment is quiet but exacting. Observation records deviations, noting what worked and what could improve. Watchfulness cycles repeat: attention, action, evaluation. The spire teaches that outcomes are data, and that careful reflection informs the next move.
