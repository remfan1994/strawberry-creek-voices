Anchor 29 – Witness

The water reflects, but it also receives. Leaves, light, shadow — all are taken in without possession. The creek shows how to witness without hoarding, how to be marked without becoming rigid. What it carries forward is not everything it encounters, only what belongs to the flow.

Mallards drift where the current slows, adjusting their position without effort. A great egret stands motionless at the edge, watching the water without claiming it. Neither interrupts the flow. Both remain present.

The creek accepts their attention without altering itself. Observation passes through without possession. The freedom of movement above depends on the holding below, even if unnoticed.

Here, awareness does not demand control.
It keeps company and lets go.
