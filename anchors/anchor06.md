Anchor 6 – Memory without complaint

The creek remembers fallen redwood needles, oak acorns, bay leaves, maple samaras, and branches that touched the water long ago. No one asks for them back. No one laments their absence. The water carries the shape, the story, quietly, as if memory itself does not need applause.

A dark-eyed junco pauses by the edge, pecking at a bay laurel seed, and the creek listens without interrupting. It folds these movements into all the echoes it has gathered: the skip of a Pacific tree frog across alder leaves, the rustle of a squirrel among oak branches, a whispered argument, a sigh released under the boughs. Everything settles gently into the undercurrent, neither praised nor scolded.

Even mistakes, small cruelties, moments of forgetfulness—all float into the creek’s slow embrace. And in its patience, the creek shows that remembering need not carry bitterness. Every story, every footstep, every fallen redwood needle is kept with care, and every current moves on.
