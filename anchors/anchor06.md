Anchor 6 – Memory without complaint

The creek remembers fallen leaves, seeds carried by the wind, and branches that touched the water long ago. No one asks for them back. No one laments their absence. The water carries the shape, the story, quietly, as if memory itself does not need applause.

A bird pauses by the edge, pecking at a seed, and the creek listens without interrupting. It folds these movements into all the echoes it has gathered: the skip of a frog across stones, the rustle of a squirrel, a whispered argument, a sigh released under the boughs. Everything settles gently into the undercurrent, neither praised nor scolded.

Even mistakes, small cruelties, moments of forgetfulness—all float into the creek’s slow embrace. And in its patience, the creek shows that remembering need not carry bitterness. Every story, every footstep, every fallen petal is kept with care, and every current moves on.
